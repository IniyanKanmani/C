Birmingham has been challenging and developing great minds for more than a 
century. Characterised by a tradition of innovation, research at the 
University has broken new ground, pushed forward the boundaries of 
knowledge and made an impact on peopleâ€™s lives. We continue this 
tradition today and have ambitions for a future that will embed our work 
and recognition of the Birmingham name on the international stage.
